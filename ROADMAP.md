# Forensics Toolkit Roadmap

## Overview

This roadmap outlines the development and improvement plan for the Forensics Toolkit, focusing on enhancing testing infrastructure and overall project maturity.

## Testing Enhancement Roadmap

### Current State Assessment

- **Existing Tests**: Basic Pester tests in `Tests/` folder
- **Coverage**: Limited unit tests for core modules
- **Automation**: Basic test runner via `RunTests.ps1`
- **Status**: Needs expansion for comprehensive coverage

### Phase 1: Foundation (Q4 2025) - IN PROGRESS

- [x] **Audit Existing Tests**
  - Reviewed all current test files (3 unit test files)
  - Identified structure and coverage gaps
  - Documented test dependencies (Pester 3.4.0 â†’ 5.x)
- [x] **Test Framework Standardization**
  - Updated Pester from 3.4.0 to 5.7.1
  - Migrated configuration to Pester 5 format
  - Enabled code coverage analysis
  - Updated test runner for modern Pester
- [x] **Unit Test Expansion**
  - Migrated all test assertions to Pester 5 syntax
  - Added unit tests for EvidenceCollection-Core module
  - Increased test count from 41 to 50 tests
  - Improved test reliability and coverage
- [ ] **Test Framework Standardization** (remaining)
  - Implement consistent test naming conventions
  - Create shared test utilities and mocks
  - Expand test fixtures with more sample data

### Phase 2: Integration Testing (Q1 2026)

- [ ] **Module Integration Tests**
  - Create tests for module interactions
  - Test cross-module dependencies
  - Validate data flow between components
- [ ] **End-to-End Workflow Tests**
  - Test complete forensic analysis workflows
  - Validate evidence collection pipelines
  - Test reporting generation processes
- [ ] **Performance Testing**
  - Benchmark critical functions
  - Test memory usage for large datasets
  - Validate execution times for common operations

### Phase 3: Advanced Testing (Q2 2026)

- [ ] **Security Testing**
  - Test for secure handling of sensitive data
  - Validate input sanitization
  - Test privilege escalation scenarios
- [ ] **Compatibility Testing**
  - Test across different Windows versions
  - Validate with various PowerShell versions
  - Test in different execution environments
- [ ] **Load Testing**
  - Test with large evidence sets
  - Validate concurrent operations
  - Test resource limits and failure modes

### Phase 4: Automation and CI/CD (Q3 2026)

- [ ] **CI/CD Pipeline Integration**
  - Integrate tests into automated build pipeline
  - Implement test-driven development practices
  - Add code quality gates
- [ ] **Test Automation Enhancements**
  - Automated test generation for new modules
  - Continuous test execution on changes
  - Automated regression testing
- [ ] **Documentation and Training**
  - Create testing guidelines for contributors
  - Document test writing best practices
  - Train team on testing procedures

### Phase 5: Monitoring and Maintenance (Q4 2026)

- [ ] **Test Metrics and Reporting**
  - Implement test coverage reporting
  - Track test execution metrics
  - Generate test health dashboards
- [ ] **Continuous Improvement**
  - Regular test audits and updates
  - Incorporate user feedback into testing
  - Maintain test suite relevance
- [ ] **Community Contributions**
  - Enable community test contributions
  - Review and integrate external test cases
  - Foster testing community engagement

## Success Metrics

- **Code Coverage**: Target 90%+ for all modules
- **Test Execution Time**: < 5 minutes for full suite
- **Test Reliability**: 99% pass rate in CI/CD
- **Documentation**: Complete testing guides and examples

## Dependencies

- Pester framework updates
- CI/CD infrastructure setup
- Team training on testing practices
- Stakeholder alignment on testing priorities

## Risks and Mitigations

- **Resource Constraints**: Prioritize high-impact tests first
- **Complexity**: Start with simple tests, gradually increase depth
- **Maintenance Overhead**: Automate as much as possible
- **Changing Requirements**: Regular roadmap reviews and updates

## Timeline Summary

- **Q4 2025**: Foundation and unit testing
- **Q1-Q2 2026**: Integration and advanced testing
- **Q3-Q4 2026**: Automation, monitoring, and maintenance
