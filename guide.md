# what i want to be done in the project

I have the following repository with a powershell profile https://github.com/tears-mysthrala/PowerShell-profile and i want to make a new profile that is focused on forensics and incident response.

## Goals

1. Create a new branch for the forensics profile.
2. Remove any unnecessary components from the existing profile that are not relevant to forensics and incident response.
3. Develop a set of PowerShell functions and cmdlets tailored for forensic analysis and incident response.
4. Ensure the new profile is well-documented and includes usage examples.
5. Integrate any necessary third-party tools or modules that enhance forensic capabilities.
6. Test the new profile thoroughly to ensure reliability and effectiveness in real-world scenarios.
